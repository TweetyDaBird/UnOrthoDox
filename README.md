# UnOrthoDox
A 'simple' and low cost hot-swap Numpad (available in 17-18 or 20 key versions) with support for dual encoders, and using a low cost but powerfull controller (RP2040-Zero). The design is dual sided, so flipping it over and building it as a 'SouthPaw' configuration is outright easy. A single plate/case design with cut-outs for all key configurations available in Black or White makes it easy to build a complete Numpad that fit's in well witha 60% keyboard in size and looks. The same plates/components fit both the 20-key PCB variant and the PCB-variant for a 17-18 key classic numpad layout. 

The name comes from the slightly unortodox placement of the controller straddling the hot-swap socket, with not all pins soldered, and the fact that it can be built as a 20-key ortholinear macro pad.
